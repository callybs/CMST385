        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>In my journey, nothing came easily. It all began when I embraced the spirit of a locomotive, affectionately nicknamed "Tata" by my father. He believed that a locomotive carried not just people and objects, but dreams as well, and it could never stop.

            I assembled my dedicated team: Almir, my husband and manager, as the driver; Kellen, my daughter and a businesswoman, as the attendant; Cally, my son and marketing expert, as the visionary; and myself, the alchemist.
            
            The concept originated in 1992 but was only brought to life in 2018. During this time, I gained extensive knowledge in functional aromatherapy and herbology. We focused on creating products that promote well-being and a level of care that the market often overlooks. Over the years, I've strived to perfect the raw materials we use, crafting something truly personalized.</p>
